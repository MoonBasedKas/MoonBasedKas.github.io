    Hello, I'm Kas, I'm a recent Computer Science Graduate, I enjoy programming. I got into programming from video games
    I've always been interested in the code behind video games. A lot of my early interactions with computer science and
    programming
    were influenced by a goal I had in school to make a video game one day. I would first program in 2014 when I had
    programming class at a local library. It was using Scratch however, I felt the visual based nature of Scratch added
    a lot of extra
    tedium. In 2015 I would take a Python programming course. After A few lessons I would attempt to learn Unity
    however, I had not gone much
    further besides some small python projects. I decided I wanted to be a Computer Scientist in 2019 when I took my
    first computer science
    course. We did a lot of programming in Python and I enjoyed the challenge it brought.

    Unforantely, I don't have any of my old programming projects as they've been lost to time and only remember a few
    and I hadn't
    learned about git or github until 2021 and didnt use until a year later after I lost my final project for a C
    programming course.

    Hello, I am Kas. I'm a recent Computer Science Graduate. I enjoy programming, a lot of my early reason why I wanted
    to learn how to program was from video games.
    I always thought the work that went to make them working was literal magic and I wanted to understand so I could do
    it myself. Now with a Computer Science degree
    I can definitely say, its still literal magic any of the games we have nowadays are playable. I started programming
    in 2015 using Python, I wouldn't get too into
    programming until 2019 when I took my first computer science class. While taking this class I enjoyed it enough to
    decide I'd watnt to attend university for Computer Science. Unforantely I hadn't been using git or even github
    to store code until 2022, all of my early projects had been lost to time. I don't remember most of them besides my
    final projects of each class being the following.
  <ul>
    <li>A TUI calculator written in Python</li>
    <li>A TUI aracade written in Python.</li>
    <li>A TUI version of the game of life written in C.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    My favorite programming language is python and I enjoy using it however, GDScript may overthrow its position due to
    its python like nature and it being part of the game engine Godot. I'm proficent with C and Python programming and
    have
    a lot of expierence in Java. I'm familiar with JavaScript from my various website projects and Kotlin from my Kotlin
    Compiler.

    <h2>
      Pizza Protocol
    </h2>
    Pizza protocol is my first game and is a game about programming. In Pizza Protocol you're tasked with making a
    program
    which is able to navigate a city to a target destination. You are given programming blocks and must program a
    solution.
    After you've programmed your solution you then run and watch what happens. The game uses a custom VPL (visual
    programming language)
    called Pizza Bytes. A nice feature about this game is that it can become a possible IDE so long as you
    program the visuals, currently the game language is interpreted but you could turn this into a compiler as well
    if you want. I may look into further support of Pizza Byte as a language as I think a compiled VPL language
    is an interesting idea. This was my first expierence with Godot and the GDScript language.

    <h2>K0</h2>
    <p>
      K0 is a kotlin toy compiler that targets x86. K0 was made using C, Bison, and FLEX. Perhaps my largest programming
      project yet.
      I worked as part of a three person team and made the compiler 4 months.

    <h2>NeoBean</h2>
    <p>
      NeoBean is a college scheduling application for the University of New Mexico Tech as Tech leaves a desire for
      better scheduling software.
      This project started after Beanweb went down and students didn't have anything to use for a semester. This was my
      first website and on this project
      I worked on the web scrapper. The webscrapper was made in Python using beatutiful soup.

    <h2>
      Tomcat Donut Store
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tomcat Donut Store is a website made using Apache Tomcat and JSP. The website interfaces with a sql database using
      mysql connector. This was a five person project which was done over the course of two months. I took an active
      role
      in the development of the database and back end. In the last half of the project I would become the team lead
      and ensure that the team was able to complete this project. The website is meant to act as a inventory manangement
      and online store front for a fictional store.

    <h2>
      SouthernROCAireDales
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a website I built as a freelance project as a main page for a Airedale dog breeder. I developed this
      website
      using Python, flask, and Jinja Templates. This website interfaces with a SQL database using mysql connector. I was
      working alone on
      this project and I took the role of the developer and designer for the web page.

    <h2>
      Evil Cereal
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a video game that plays like overcooked the video game. It was made in less than 12 hours for the GMTK
      2025 Game Jam after we decided to restart with a new idea which took up the previous 84 hours we had.
      This game was developed using GDScript in the Godot engine. In this game you are working at a cereal shop where
      you must serve cereal to your
      customers. For this game I would handle the programming and had a team member who handled the art.
